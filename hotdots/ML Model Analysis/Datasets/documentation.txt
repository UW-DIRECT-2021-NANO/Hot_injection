Can we document how we edited and augmented the dataset?

1. raw from reference
2. manually went back through references and expanded dataset
	- any more syntheses to add?
	- added outcomes absorbance (nm) and emission (nm)
3. cleaning up new dataset
	- column transformers to scale
	- dealing with None values
	- cleaning up data that had typos/missing units/trailing spaces/data in wrong place
4. dealing with None values in outcomes
	- None values for absorbance were predicted by bagging, decision trees, random forests (MSE 91.7)
	- None values for PL were predicted using same (RF MSE 177)
