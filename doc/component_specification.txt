Use Cases:
1. Alex is a chemistry undergrad student, and he needs to synthesize CdSe quantum dots for his 
grad student mentor. His mentor specifically requests that the material absorb and emit between 
570-580 nm and are around 3nm in size. However, Alex is new to this field and is overwhelmed 
by all of the literature, some of which are contradicting. He doesn't know which procedure to 
follow and doesn't have time to read all of the papers. He can guess and modify an existing prep, 
but he cannot find one that suits his exact needs. Alex is confused.

2. Clay is a chemistry grad student who has some experience with the synthesis of nanoparticles. 
He has already asked his undergrad to help him synthesize one batch of CdSe quantum dots. 
Clay needs to run a dozen more experiments modifying the conditions of the synthesis. He wants
to adjust the temperature and the solvents of the reaction to see if the size, absorbance and 
emission are different.This specific set of experiments has never been reported before. But Clay 
can only come to the lab twice a week due to COVID. Clay knows that in group meeting on Friday, 
his PI will be mad if he doesn't have the data. Clay is frustrated.

3. Zach is a demanding chemistry professor with a large group of grad students and undergrads 
studying synthesis and properties of colloidal nanocrystals. He knows that, despite the substantial
improvement over the past decades, synthesising quantum dots is still too Edisonian (trial and 
error). Zach thinks that if he knew all of the existing literature, he could identify patterns and
correlations and start to synthesise new quantum dots even more intenionally, systematically, and 
efficiently. Zach is curious.
