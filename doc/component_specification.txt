Use Cases:
1. Alex is a chemistry undergrad student, and he needs to synthesize CdSe quantum dots for his grad student mentor. His mentor requests that the material absorbs and emits in the range 570-580 nm and leaves the rest up to Alex. However, Alex is new to this field and is overwhelmed by all the literature, some of which are contradicting. Alex doesn't know which procedure to follow and doesn't have time to read all of the papers. Alex is confused.

Components Specification:

1. User Interface

	- Name: QuantumDotSizePredictor.py
	- Function: Receives input from user for desired experimental conditions of a hot injection synthesis, and outputs the predicted CdSe quantum dot size
	- Inputs: Growth Temperature, Metal Source, Metal Amount (mmol), Selenium Powder amount (mmol), Growth Time
	- Outputs: Expected diameter of CdSe quantum dot
	- Interaction with other components: Works with the machine learning algorithm that can best predict output 

	- Name: ExperimentalConditionPredictor.py
	- Function: Receives input from user for desired CdSe quantum dot size, and outputs an appropriate set of experimental conditions for a hot injection synthesis
	- Inputs: Desired diameter of CdSe quantum dot
	- Outputs: Suggested growth temperature, metal source, metal ammount (mmol), Selenium Powder amount (mmol), Growth Time
	- Interaction with other components: The initial dataset and the machine learning algorithms

2. Machine learning algorithms
	
	- Name: Each model is labelled accordingly in each submodule
